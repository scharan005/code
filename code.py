Abstract
This paper presents an optimized approach for deploying the Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) in both Python and C++ environments. Leveraging the oneDNN PyTorch Plugin and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation through the Inductor path, we provide a seamless workflow to enhance model performance. Our solution focuses on generating efficient .so files for C++ while retaining compatibility with Python exports, ensuring interoperability and scalability. Benchmark results demonstrate that the C++ environment outperforms the PyTorch environment, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Introduction
Recommendation systems like the Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) are pivotal in applications that require personalized experiences, such as e-commerce and social media platforms. While PyTorch provides an excellent framework for model development, deploying models in high-performance C++ environments remains challenging. Transitioning from Python to C++ often involves trade-offs in compatibility and performance.

This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a pipeline that integrates the oneDNN PyTorch Plugin with AOT Inductor to optimize DLRM for deployment in C++ environments. By aligning the deployment pipeline with hardware optimizations from oneDNN, this solution ensures reduced latency and higher throughput, meeting the performance demands of modern recommendation systems.
